# Game Spy

Game Spy is a price comparison application for Consoles and Games, it indexes common retailers and allows users to utilise image, text and proximity searching to find the cheapest items nearest to them.

The application supports a completely fictional scenario and has only been written to cater for my 3rd year final project, for advanced database systems at Plymouth University.  

NOTE: This software has been built for Oracle's APEX
